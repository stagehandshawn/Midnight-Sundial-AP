# Midnight-Sundial
This is an Arduino code for NodeMCU to run a NeoPixel clock.

The updated code will allow for updating the time manually to better calibrate the clocks mounting point. Custom color mixes by sending web requests, and a landing page with current state of clock.
Has serial debug as well.

Looking to update later to allow for timezone changes without re compiling.

This is the first code I have wrote in more than a decade and it is not something I do very often, hope its ok.

The instructions on printed parts as well as a wiring diagram can be found on PrusaPrinters site:

There is also a video on Youtube showing the whole thing working:
